# Requirements for the New Version

## Multitenant
The one Trevor Lohrbeer used for GPT Builder Toolkit is [Supastarter](https://supastarter.dev/). If that doesn't look like it'll work for you, you may want to look at [Shipixen](https://shipixen.com/) or one of the starter kits listed [here](https://saasstarters.com/tags/nodejs/) or [here](https://phlaunchchecklist.com/saas-starter-kits/). Or just search for "saas starter kit" to find others that have been released since he bookmarked those.

## Reminder Content and Channels
- Standard generic reminder messages that can be used in any county without change.
- Ability to change reminder messages without a rebuild.
- Include site name and unsubscribe information in every message
- When unsubscribing, ask if they want us to keep phone for another 6 months to ensure future court dates

## Site Content
- Add language re: data privacy/use directly on the signup page, e.g., "This service is not maintained by the courts or law enforcement, and phone numbers are used only to send text reminders and deleted once there are no more court dates"
- Improve guidance on signup by letting people know what to expect, e.g., "Once you press 'SUBMIT', you should receive a confirmation text. If you did not, make sure you are using a phone that can receive a text (not a land line, for example). Also, check the phone number to make sure you put in the right number."


## Administration
- Admin screens to easily look up if someone is subscribed, when, etc.
- Better logging generally
- Ability to review everything that has happened with a subscriber/defendant (including when court dates changed?).


## Notes
