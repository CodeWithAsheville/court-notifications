// NOTE: As of now, we don't have any need to customize the 
// sass variables from uswds. If we need to do so in the future,
// we'd need to import the sass version of this. To do so, 
// we'll need to add a new --load-path for dart-sass, because
// our app is structured as a monorepo, and the uswds dep
// is installed in the top level node_modules outside the 
// packages directory. I'm not sure how to do this atm without
// ejecting create-react-app, and I always want to avoid that on
// this simple and small and volunteer led project. Another solution
// might be forcing the uswds dependency to be installed in the 
// client directory's node_modules. For now, this is the fastest
// solution.

// For some reason the line below started causing an error when
// running 'yarn client' with the message 
//
//       SassError: Operators aren't allowed in plain CSS
//
// Decided for now to just comment out the line below, copy
// suwds.min.css into the public folder and add
//
//           <link  rel="stylesheet"  href="./uswds.min.css" />
//
// to index.html.

//@use '../../../node_modules/uswds/dist/css/uswds.min.css'
